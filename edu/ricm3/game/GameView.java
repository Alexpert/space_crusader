/**
 * This is your game view, a canvas where the game is displayed.
 * 
 * It extends the AWT canvas, a widget that is essentially an area of pixels,
 * suited to draw on it. You can draw pixels or shapes such as lines, polygones,
 * or circles. Look for these capabilitis in the class java.awt.Graphics.
 * You can also draw images and therefore you can do animations.
 * 
 * We extended the AWT canvas to have an efficient double buffering.
 * You can read https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_buffering
 * as an introduction.
 * 
 * Note that you can turn double buffering off in Options.USE_DOUBLE_BUFFERING.
 * We suggest that you leave it on.
